\chapter{Background}


\section{Anatomy of Heart}
The function of the heart is to pump the blood inside the body, which is stimulated by an electrical stimulus \cite{wilkins2005ecg} \cite{electric_activity_heart}. The heart pumps blood to the different parts of the body such as organs, muscles, and tissues.

The heart shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:heart_anatomy} is made up of 4 chambers, left and right atria, and left and right ventricles. The right atrium receives de-oxygenated blood from the whole body and pumps it into the right ventricle which then pumps the blood to the lungs for increasing oxygenation. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it into the left ventricles which then pumps the oxygenated blood to the whole body. The aorta carries oxygenated blood to the different part of the body and the pulmonary arteries carry the de-oxygenated blood back to the lungs for improving oxygenation. The blood flows to different organs via arteries and returns back to the heart via veins.

The main components of the cardiac conduction system are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Synoatrial (SA) node
	\item The Atrioventricular (AV) node
	\item Atrioventricular (AV) bundle or bundle of His
	\item Right and left bndle branches
	\item Purkinje fibers
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}




The SA node, also known as sinus node, is a natural pacemaker of the heart which is located in the right atrium. It produces an electrical stimulus at the rate of 60 to 100 signals per minute (under normal condition), which travels through the heart to make it pump the blood to the body. It initiates all heartbeats and determines the heart rate. The electrical impulse from the SA node spread throughout the atrium which results in the contraction of the atrium. The AV node which is located on the other side of the right atrium, near the AV valve, serve as a gateway to the ventricles. It also delays the passage of electrical impulse to the ventricles. This is to ensure that all the blood is ejected from the atria to the ventricles before the ventricles contract. The AV node then passes the signal to the atrioventricular (AV) bundle or bundle of His. The bundle is divided into two parts, right and left bundle branches to stimulate the right and left ventricles. The signal then travels down to the Purkinje fibers, where the signal spreads upwards throughout the ventricular myocardium. Each contraction of the ventricles represents one single heartbeat.

Each heartbeat is composed of two phases, known as systole and diastole. During \textbf{systole}, the heart muscles contract and the blood is pumped from ventricles to the different parts of the body. During \textbf{diastole}, the hearts muscles relax and the blood from atria flows into the ventricles. The pressure generated during systole from the ventricular contraction is high, whereas, during diastole, due to the muscle relaxation this pressure reduces.

The electrical activity of the heart can be detected in the form of electrocardiogram by placing electrodes on the body surface. It is a powerful tool for diagnosing the status of patient's heart.



\section{The Electrocardiogram} \label{the_electrocardiogram}

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential tool for diagnosing the electrical activity of the heart \cite{wilkins2005ecg}. It is a simple and non-invasive procedure to measure the activity of the heart. Most of the tools available today to measure the ECG are based on the electrodes which are required to be attached to the body. The electrodes sense the electrical potentials of the body and transmit them to the ECG monitor. These voltages are then transformed into appropriate waveforms which represent the heart's polarization and depolarization cycle. Different components of the wave represent the activity of different parts of the heart.


In conventional 12-lead ECG, only 10 electrodes or leads are attached to the patient's body and the electrical activity of the heart can be viewed from 12 different perspectives \cite{cablesandsensors}. These 12 views of the heart are captured by placing the electrodes on chest, wrists, and ankles. The main purpose of ECG is to identify any cardiac arrhythmia, ischemia, problems with heart rate or any other irregularities.

These 10 electrodes are divided into 2 groups. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 6 chest electrodes
	\item 4 limb electrodes
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=6cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/6_lead_placement}
	\caption{
		The leads position on chest\cite{TUON:six_leads}.
	}
	\label{fig:6_lead_placement}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Chest Electrodes}
The chest electrodes are denoted as ``V'' and they all are numbered from V1 to V6 as can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:6_lead_placement}. The electrodes are positioned at the following locations on the chest:

\begin{itemize}
	\item V1 - Fourth intercostal space (between ribs 4 and 5) on the right sternum
	\item V2 - Fourth intercostal space (between ribs 4 and 5) on the left sternum
	\item V3 - Placed in the middle of V2 and V4
	\item V4 - Fifth intercostal space (between ribs 5 and 6) at the mid-clavicular line
	\item V5 - Placed horizontally on anterior axillary line with V4
	\item V6 - Placed horizontally on Mid-axillary line with V4 and V5
\end{itemize} 


The 3 different axillary lines \textbf{anterior axillary line}, \textbf{midaxillary line}, and \textbf{posterior axillary line} can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:axillary_lines}.

	\caption{
		The axillary lines on the right side of chest\cite{wiki:aux_lines}.
	}
	\label{fig:axillary_lines}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Limb Electrodes}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=6cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/Limb_leads}
	\caption{
		The possible position of limb leads\cite{wiki:limb_leads}.
	}
	\label{fig:limb_leads}
\end{figure}

The 4 limb electrodes are denoted as RA, LA, LL, RL and there respective positions are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item RA - Anywhere on right arm between shoulder and elbow, but avoiding thick muscles.
	\item LA - Symmetric to the RA position, but on left arm
	\item RL - Anywhere on right leg between the torso and the ankle
	\item LL - Symmetric to the RL position, but on left leg
\end{itemize} 

The limb electrodes are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:limb_leads}


\section{ECG Complex}
ECG complex represents the electrical activity of the heart during one cardiac cycle \cite{wilkins2005ecg}. A normal cardiac cycle consists of five waveforms labeled with P, Q, R, S and T as can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:SinusRhythmLabels}. The Q, R and S waves are referred to as one unit, the QRS complex. The ECG signal represents the conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. The important parameters in the ECG signal are:

\subsection{P Wave}

The P wave is the first component of the ECG signal. It occurs due to contraction of both left and right atrium. This process is also known as atrial depolarization. A normal P wave has following characteristics (in lead II):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.06 to 0.12 seconds
	\item Amplitude: 2 to 3 mm high
	\item Location: before the QRS complex
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=6cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/SinusRhythmLabels}
	\caption{
		The ECG signal\cite{wiki:SinusRhythmLabels}.
	}
	\label{fig:SinusRhythmLabels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{QRS Complex}
The QRS complex follows the P wave and represents a contraction of both right and left ventricles. This contraction results in the blood ejection from the heart which eventually pumps into the arteries and create a pulse. The Q and S waves are relatively very small whereas, R wave is comparatively very big. A normal QRS complex has following characteristics (in lead II):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.06 to 0.10 seconds
	\item Amplitude: 5 to 30 mm high
	\item Location: follows the P wave
\end{itemize}

\subsection{T Wave}
The T wave represents the ventricles repolarization. It occurs during the last part of ventricle systole. The T wave has following characteristics (in lead II):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.10 to 0.25 seconds or greater
	\item Amplitude: <5 mm high
	\item Location: follows the QRS complex
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PR Interval}
The PR interval is the time interval between the end of contraction of the atria and the beginning of contraction of the ventricles. A normal PR interval has following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.12 to 0.20 seconds
	\item Location: From the beginning of P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ST Segment}
The ST segment represents the end of ventricular depolarization and the beginning of the ventricles relaxation. The point between the end of QRS complex and the beginning of ST segment is called as the J point. A normal ST segment has following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.08 to 0.12 seconds
	\item Location: From the end of QRS complex to the beginning of T wave
\end{itemize}

\subsection{QT Interval}
The QT interval is the time interval between the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. The QT duration varies according to the heart rate. Faster heart rate results in smaller QT interval whereas, slower heart rate may result in a bigger QT interval. The bigger QT interval may result in an irregular heartbeat. A normal QT interval has following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration: 0.36 to 0.44 seconds
	\item Location: From the beginning of QRS complex to the end of T wave
\end{itemize}

\section{Disadvantages of Attached Electrodes} \label{electrodes_disadv}

While it is easy to monitor the electrical heart activity by placing the electrodes directly on the body but it has several disadvantages as well.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It limits the patient's mobility.
	\item Discomfort for the patient as electrodes are directly attached to the body.
	\item Loss of cardiac monitoring in case if patient moves.
	\item Long time contact of the electrodes may irritate the skin.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Noise in ECG Signal}
Typically the ECG signal can  corrupted by the different types of noises and artifacts which changes the characteristics of the ECG signal \cite{limaye2016ecg}. Hence, it is difficult to extract the useful information from the signal. Following are the major noises, which are present in the ECG signal.

\subsection{Power Line Interference}
Power line interference is a 50 Hz noise, which is present in ECG signal because of the improper grounding of the ECG equipment or interference from the nearby equipment. In order to remove this type of noise, a proper use of a filter is required. A 50 Hz notch filter can be used to remove the power line interference. Figure ~\ref{fig:ACInterference} illustrates the 50 Hz power line interference in ECG signal.

\begin{figure}[htpb]

	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=7cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/ACInterference}
	\caption{
		AC Interference of 50Hz\cite{ecg_artifacts}.
	}
	\label{fig:ACInterference}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Baseline wander}
Baseline wander is a low-frequency component which corrupts the ECG signal because of breathing, body movements, dirty or lose electrodes or electrode impedance. Generally, they have a frequency greater than 1 Hz. A high pass filter can be used to remove the baseline wander. The baseline wandering in ECG signal can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:WBaseline}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=7cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/WBaseline}
	\caption{
		Baseline wandering in ECG signal\cite{ecg_artifacts}.
	}
	\label{fig:WBaseline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Muscle Noise}
This type of noise is caused by muscle contractions besides heart, which results in the change of heart electrical potential \cite{markovski2013ict}. Whenever the other muscles near the electrodes depolarized and repolarized, they also generate waves, which can be monitored by the ECG. They generally occur in short time burst and have higher amplitude values than the ECG signal. It can be removed using Wavelet transform \cite{6091791}. An example of ECG signal affected by muscle contractions can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:Tremor}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=7cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/Tremor}
	\caption{
		ECG signal combined with muscle noise\cite{ecg_artifacts}.
	}
	\label{fig:Tremor}
\end{figure}

\section{Arrhythmias}
Irregularity in the heartbeat is known as arrhythmia (also called dysrhythmia) ~\cite{medicinenet}. During an arrhythmia, a heart is out of normal rhythm and may feel like the heart has skipped a beat or beat with an irregular pattern. A normal heart rate lies between 60 to 100 beats per minute and arrhythmia can occur with normal heart rate,  slow heart rate (called bradycardia), in which heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute or with rapid heart rate (called tachycardia) in which heart beats faster than 100 beats
per minute.



\subsection{Causes of Arrhythmia}
Arrhytmia can be caused by one of the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Heart disease
	\item Electrolyte imbalance
	\item Changes in heart muscle
	\item After surgery effects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Arrhythmias}

The most common types of arrhythmias are:

\subsubsection{Premature Ventricular Contraction}
It is one type of arrhythmia, in which the heartbeat is initiated by the ventricles rather than the SA node. It is generally referred as ``skipped beat''. This is the most common type of arrhythmia, which occurs with or without any heart disease. It could be the result of too much stress, usage of too much cocaine or restless. Sometimes it can also be caused by heart disease. However, most of the time PVC is considered as harmless and rarely needs a treatment.

\begin{figure}[htpb]

	\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=7cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/pvc}
	\caption{
		Premature Ventricular Contraction\cite{wiki:pvc}.
	}
	\label{fig:pvc}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Atrial Fibrillation}
This type of arrhythmia caused by the abnormal contraction of the upper chamber of the heart. During atrial fibrillation, the atria beat irregularly without any coordination with the ventricles. This could results in heart palpation, shortness of breath and weakness.


\subsubsection{Atrial Flutter}
This type of arrhythmia caused by problems in the heart's electrical system. It is similar to atrial fibrillation but rhythm in atria is more organized than the atrial fibrillation. The risk factors and causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=15cm,height=12cm,keepaspectratio=true]{images/af}
	\caption{
		Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Flutter and Tachycardia\cite{sumdu}.
	}
	\label{fig:af}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Bradycardia}
In this type of arrhythmia, the heart beats slower than the normal pace, usually less than 60 beats per minute. This could be because of the disease in electrical heart system.

\subsubsection{Tachycardia}
In this type of arrhythmia, the heart beats faster than the normal pace, usually, more than 100 beats per minute. When the heart beats too fast, it may not pump blood effectively to the body parts, which could result in shortness of breath.

\subsubsection{Heart Block}
In this type of arrhythmia, the heart beats slowly because of the delay or complete block of the electrical signal between the upper chambers and the lower chambers of the heart. It is also called atrial ventricular block (AV block).

\subsubsection{Bundle Branch Block}
Bundle branch block can be of two types, left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB). In a normal heart, both bundles depolarized simultaneously and contract at the same time. In this type of arrhythmia, the affected bundle depolarized slowly whereas the un-affected bundle depolarized normally which results in a broader QRS complex, generally longer than 120 milliseconds duration. LBBB and RBBB can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:LRBBB}.
