\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, a software system has been developed, which can measure various vital parameters of pilot, including the accurate detection of QRS complex, and can detect cardiac conditions using CNN in real-time. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.2\%, whereas, in real-time the model has an accuracy of 88\%. The CNN model has been trained to classify four different types of arrhythmia. Moreover, our system can classify ECG signals in a real-time environment.

A dashboard has been setup where the type of ECG signal classified by CNN, sensors signals and vital parameters of the pilot can be monitored. 

Main results and achievements of the work reported in this thesis can be summarized in the following points


A number of techniques, including digital filters and Wavelet transform have been applied in order to process raw sensors signals and remove noise and artifacts from them.


An algorithm has been implemented based on Wavelet transform to extract the ECG features and important waves such P, QRS complex and T waves. The wavelet transform method has shown an high accuracy in the detection of QRS complexes and other waves, which is an essential step for ECG arrhythmias detection, classification and extraction of vital parameters.

Various datasets are collected, processed and cleaned in order to trained a CNN model.
