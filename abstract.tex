\chapter{Abstract}

Traditional sensors which required a direct contact with the body are old fashioned now, as they make trouble in the daily activities. A non-contact multi-sensors has been implemented to show the power of non contact sensors. 

pilot usecase has been considered while making the system.

A CNN model has also trained to detect various cardiac conditions in a real-time environment. A cloud based interface has been set up so the the health status can be tracked from any where in the world. 

The work described in this thesis, presented a big data architecture as well. also implemented the modified versin of the architecture.
